## ⚙️ How It Works

- The frontend is built using Vite.
- The backend runs as a Serverless Function inside `/api`.
- In production, API calls are made using `/api` (no localhost needed).
- Optimized for seamless deployment on Vercel.

## 🧪 Run Locally

### 1. Install dependencies

npm install


### 2. Run development server


Frontend will run on:

http://localhost:5173

## ☁️ Deploy

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel.

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import repository into Vercel
3. Select **Vite** as Framework Preset
4. Deploy

Serverless functions will automatically run from the `/api` directory.

## 📌 Purpose

This boilerplate was created to:

- Speed up fullstack project initialization
- Provide a clean reusable architecture
- Simplify serverless deployment workflow
- Serve as a foundation for dashboards, SaaS apps, and internal tools
